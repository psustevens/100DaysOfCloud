# Committing and Pushing to Github

## Introduction

This post will cover how I use Github Desktop to commit changes to my Github repositository then push them up to Github.

## Prerequisite

1. You need to have Github Desktop downloaded and installed

## Use Case

Part of using the cloud is that you can use, what I am referring to as, "disposable" infrastructure.  What I mean is that you no longer have to rack/stack servers anymore to get started.  This is the cloud providers responsibility. However, you do need to install the applications and deploy the proper virtual machines for running said applications.  In order to do this in a consistent and repeatable way you will become familiar with a concept known as Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC).

The idea behind Infrastructure-as-Code is that, depending on the cloud provider, you will describe and deploy infrastructure such as compute, storage, and networking and the configuration of the infrastructure using a "language" of sorts.  Other tools such as Terraform, Puppet, Chef and others can also be used for describing and deploying cloud infrastructure.

As your infrastructure evolves over time you will develop different versions of the virtual hardware and configuration.  So, what better place to store these versions is up in Github.
